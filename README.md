Study project, follow the base of the youtube channel project Dev Manual by the tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF0DxaY_lTM ;
In my study time I followed the tutorial and was creating along with the video, changed some things like the background and the delete button, but all the code was as a study base. 
I recommend the Dev Manual channel for studies because the tutorials are complete and the teaching is explanatory, very good for learning.
